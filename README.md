# Smart Contract for Joint Savings Account
![Smart Contract](./Execution_Results/smart_contract.jpeg)
In order to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, a Solidity smart contract was created. The smart contract accepts two user addresses that are able to control the joint savings account. Ethereum management functions were written in the smart contract to fulfull a financial institution's requirements of having the necessary features for a joint savings account. For example, the features include being able to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies
This project leverages the following tools:
* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) - programming language for implementing smart contracts
* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) - open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser; has modules for testing, debugging, and deploying of smart contracts

The Solidity version used for this project was the following:
`pragma solidity ^0.5.0`

## Instalation Guide
There are no major installations required. You can access Remix IDE from the web browser. 

---

## Usage
1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) 
2. Open the smart contract file (`joint_savings.sol`) in Remix IDE. (You may need to create a new file and copy and paste the Solidity code to the file)
3. Select the "Solidity Compiler" tab and press the button that says, "Compile joint_savings.sol"
4. Select the "Deploy and Run Transactions" tab and choose the environment of **JavaScript VM**
5. Interact with the functions of the smart contract 

---

## Methods
1. Create and work within a local blockchain development environment using the JavaScript VM provided by the Remix IDE
2. Script and deploy a **JointSavings** smart contract
3. Interact with the deployed smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds
